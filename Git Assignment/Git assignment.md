# Git assignment

1. When Jack performs the git clone command, the repository is copied to Jack's local computer. A folder with the repository's name is created. Inside that, a .git folder and the files in the repo are created. 
	
	When Jack commits and pushes after making edits, the files in the repo are updated.
	
	After Jack and Sam both edit files, push by Jack is successful but push by Sam is unsuccessful due to being one step behind the repository. Sam has to issue a pull command and the changes are auto-merged. Then he can push the code which will include both the changes made by him and Jack.
