## Exception Handling

1.  ##### Is there any way to "get around" the strict restrictions placed on methods by the throws clause?

   Yes. Let us consider a system class has you in bind. The first solution is to subclass RuntimeException to make up a new, unchecked exception of your own. Now it can be thrown when needed because the throws clause does not need to include this new exception. A good approach is to mix in some novel exception interfaces with the new Runtime classes. The subset of interfaces that need to be catched can be chosen, i.e., the runtime exceptions need not be caught. 

2. ##### Differences between exceptions, errors, and runtime exceptions.

   Errors are caused by dynamic linking or virtual machine problems and are thus too low-level for most programs to care about - or be able to handle even if they did care about them.
   Runtime exceptions are generated by the normal execution of Java code, and although they occasionally reflect a condition you will want to handle exlicitly, more often they reflect a coding mistake made by the programmer, and thus simply need to print an error to help flag that mistake.
   Exceptions that are non-runtime exceptions (IOException exceptions, for example) are conditions that, because of their nature, should be explicitly handled by any robust and well-thought-out code. The java class library has been written using only a few of these, but those few are important to using the system safely and correctly.
